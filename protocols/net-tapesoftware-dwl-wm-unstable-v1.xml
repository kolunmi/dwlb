        <description summary="control the dwl state">
            This interface is exposed as a global in the wl_registry.

            Clients can use this protocol to receive updates of the window manager
            state (active tags, active layout, and focused window).
            Clients can also control this state.

            After binding, the client will receive the available tags and layouts
            with the 'tag' and 'layout' events. These can be used in subsequent
            dwl_wm_monitor_v1.set_tags/set_layout requests, and to interpret the
            dwl_wm_monitor_v1.layout/tag events.
